# Supply chain project

Hey there reviewer. This is my submission for the supply chain project.

## Contract address
<TODO>

## Libraries used
For the smart contracts:
* `truffle-test-utils`: used this library to simplify testing event emissions

For the frontend:
* `webpack`: I preferred using webpack since it's more powerful that lite-server

## IPFS
Unfortunately I don't have time to deploy the front end in IPFS. Neither can I deal with pic uploads :(. Might do it in the future for the learnings.

## Version numbers

* Program: `1.0.0`
* node: `v16.5.0`
* Truffle: `v5.4.6`
* web3: `^1.2.4`
